**About Me**

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Communication Science at the University of Zurich. I hold a Master's degree in Social Data Science from the University of Oxford and a Master's degree in Political Science and Political Economy from the London School of Economics. My research is in the interdisciplinary field of Computational Social Science, focusing on the application of NLP and Network Analysis to topics related to political communication and the information structures on social media.

This is where I share blog posts with insights on developments, challenges, and practical solutions in Computational Social Science from my research and valiable discussions with scholars from various disciplines. For more information about my publications, please visit:
